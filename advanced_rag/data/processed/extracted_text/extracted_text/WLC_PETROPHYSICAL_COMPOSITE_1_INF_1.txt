The WLC_PETROPHYSICAL_COMPOSITE_1.LIS has been created in accordance with the NPD 
“Guidelines to the Petroleum Regulations/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DIGITAL WELL DATA 
(Drilling Regulations, Section 12)”. 
http://www.npd.no/regelverk/R2002/B_OG_B_DIGITAL_RAPPORTERING_E.HTM#Additional_Composited_Data 
 
 
 
Purpose 
To preserve ‘specialist’ composited data curves that may be created for a well but which do not fall into the 
‘standard’ Composite (Section 3.1) or the ‘Interpreted Data Input’ data sets (described in Section 4.1). These 
data may have additional work done such as environmental or bed thickness corrections. This data set would 
normally be used by Petrophysicists. Operators are strongly recommended to report this data set in order to 
preserve value-added work. 
 
Quality 
Similar quality guidelines apply to the compositing work as described in Section 3.1.3 above. All work that is 
carried out must also be documented in an Information File. 
 
Operationally, it is expected that both the ‘standard’ Composite Log and this ‘specialized’ Composite Log 
would normally be created in the same process but split into 2 data sets for reporting purposes. This ensures 
that the same depth shifting is applied to both data sets – an important quality requirement. 
 
Content 
Data that are not part of the ‘Composited’ or ‘Interpretation Input’ data sets. This may include  
• 
additional composited resistivity, NMR or other specialized curve data 
• 
composited data at high sampling rates for thin-bed analysis 
• 
a good guide is to include all ‘presentation curves’ from log prints (apart from those already included in 
the ‘standard’ composite). If quality curves such as Tension or Cable Speed are included (not a 
requirement), information must be included in the Information Files to show which data curves they refer 
to.

Definitions: 
 
Dynamic depth shift - variable depth shifting (stretch and pull) as opposed to linear depth shifting. 
Linear depth shift - Constant depth shift through a certain depth interval. 
Reference curve - Curve that will be used as the depth Reference for a set of logging curves. 
Offset Curve - Curve that will be compared to the Reference curve in order to find required depth pairs. 
Curves shifted - Curves that will be shifted with depth pairs found by comparing Reference to Offset curve. 
Observed - Observed depth is the depth of a point before depth shifting 
Actual - Actual depth is the depth of the point after depth shifting.
