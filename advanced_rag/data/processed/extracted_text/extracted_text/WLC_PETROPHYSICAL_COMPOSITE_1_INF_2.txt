The WLC_PETROPHYSICAL_COMPOSITE_1.DLIS has been created in accordance with the NPD 
“Guidelines to the Petroleum Regulations/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR DIGITAL WELL DATA 
(Drilling Regulations, Section 12)”. 
http://www.npd.no/Global/Norsk/5%20-%20Regelverk/Tematiske%20veiledninger/B_og_b_digital_rapportering_e.pdf 
 
 
Purpose 
To preserve ‘specialist’ composited data curves that may be created for a well but which do not fall into the 
‘standard’ Composite (Section 3.1) or the ‘Interpreted Data Input’ data sets (described in Section 4.1). These 
data may have additional work done such as environmental or bed thickness corrections. This data set would 
normally be used by Petrophysicists. Operators are strongly recommended to report this data set in order to 
preserve value-added work. 
 
Quality 
Similar quality guidelines apply to the compositing work as described in Section 3.1.3 above. All work that is 
carried out must also be documented in an Information File. 
 
Operationally, it is expected that both the ‘standard’ Composite Log and this ‘specialized’ Composite Log 
would normally be created in the same process but split into 2 data sets for reporting purposes. This ensures 
that the same depth shifting is applied to both data sets – an important quality requirement. 
 
Content 
Data that are not part of the ‘Composited’ or ‘Interpretation Input’ data sets. This may include:  
 
additional composited resistivity, NMR or other specialized curve data. 
 
composited data at high sampling rates for thin-bed analysis. 
 
a good guide is to include all ‘presentation curves’ from log prints (apart from those already included in 
the ‘standard’ composite). If quality curves such as Tension or Cable Speed are included (not a 
requirement), information must be included in the Information Files to show which data curves they refer 
to.

MWD data plotted and verified to prints. 
 
 
Depth units are meters. 
 
Quality comments: 
Wellbore 15/9-F-15 C was sidetracked from 15/9-F-15 A at 2575.0m (MD). 
Wellbore 15/9-F-15 A was sidetracked from 15/9-F-15 at 1380.0m (MD). 
 
MWD ARC, run 12-13: 
13 ⅜” casing shoe at 2561.8m (from log header). 
Log Remarks: 
All depths are referenced to driller’s depth and checked at least every stand. 
All data from tool memory. 
All data acquired while drilling. 
Gamma Ray measurement is environmentally corrected for mud weight, bit size and collar thickness. 
Resistivity measurements are borehole compensated and require no environmental correction for borehole 
effect. 
This well is an open hole sidetrack of 15/9-F-15 A. 
Run 12 POOH at 2665m due to loss of directional control. 
Run 13 and 12 ¼ in. section TD at 2920m. 
 
MWD ECOSCOPE/SonicVISION BestDT, run 14: 
9 ⅝” casing shoe at 2915.0m (from log header). 
Log Remarks: 
All depths are referenced to driller’s depth and checked at least every stand. 
All data from tool memory. 
All data acquired while drilling. 
Gamma Ray measurement is environmentally corrected for mud weight, bit size and collar thickness. 
Resistivity measurements are borehole compensated and require no environmental correction for borehole 
effect. 
Bulk Density is compensated for tool standoff/mud cake. 
Neutron Porosity measurement is calculated with limestone matrix, and is environmentally corrected for bit size, 
mud weight, temperature, pressure, and mud salinity. 
8 ½ in. section TD at 3232.0m. 
SonicVISION BestDT Remarks: 
Delta-T Compressional (DTCO) derived from receiver and transmitter arrays. 
Delta-T Compressional (DTCO) processed using a 10-14 kHz filter. 
Moving Average 5 noise cut applied. 
Low coherency interval at 3100-3113m, unreliable DT labelling. 
 
Editing on WLC_PETROPHYSICAL_COMPOSITE_1.DLIS:  
MWD ECOSCOPE, run 14: 
Constant values in bottom of RHGE and SIGE have been removed. 
Resistivities are affected by casing/large borehole and have been removed above 2913.3m. 
 
Depth shifts: 
No depth shifts performed.

Definitions: 
  
Dynamic depth shift – variable depth shifting (stretch and pull) as opposed to linear depth shifting. 
Linear depth shift – Constant depth shift through a certain depth interval. 
Reference curve – Curve that will be used as the depth Reference for a set of logging curves. 
Offset Curve – Curve that will be compared to the Reference curve in order to find required depth pairs. 
Curves shifted – Curves that will be shifted with depth pairs found by comparing Reference to Offset curve. 
Observed – Observed depth is the depth of a point before depth shifting 
Actual – Actual depth is the depth of the point after depth shifting.
